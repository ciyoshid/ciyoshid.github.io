                            <h2>Home Bar Essentials</h2>
                               
                            <p>The number of bar tools and gadgets on the market are endless, but with just a handful of tools you can handle 99 percent of home bartending tasks. And we're willing to bet you already have quite a few of these in your kitchen right now.</p>
                            <p>Chances are you've already got one, but a bottle opener is necessary for opening glass bottles like those of beer and various mixers. And in terms of corkscrews: This one is pretty self-explanatory, but you need a wine opener. Today's run the gamut from your simple corkscrew to do-it-all, electric wine opener. </p>
                            <p>A jigger is basically a mini measuring cup that helps you achieve exact measures for your cocktails. A standard jigger is double sided, with one side holding 1.5 ounces on its large side (the equivalent of one shot), and ¾ to 1 ounces on its small side (or what's known as the pony shot). But you'll also find Japanese-style jiggers, which are longer and skinnier, with one side typically measuring 2 ounces and the other measuring one. You can even find literal mini measuring cups that some argue are much easier to read than traditional, double-sided jiggers. But at the end of the day, you just need one. </p>
                            <p>A mixing glass is a designated glass for stirring cocktail ingredients. You can use another glass (like a pint glass) for this purpose, but a mixing glass can be an elegant and functional addition to any home bar. 

                                Bar spoons are made with long handles specifically for stirring a mixed drink from the bottom of the glass to the top without splashing. You'll find some have smooth handles, which add extra weight, while others have textured, spiraled handles for easy grip. </p>
                            <p>Ice plays a crucial role in every cocktail you make. Skip the cloudy, odor-holding freezer ice, and instead invest in a few different ice molds and makers for making craft cocktails. Spirit-forward drinks (like Manhattans or old fashioneds) are best served with large cubes and spheres, because these take longer to melt, preventing the drink from diluting too quickly.

                                For your tiki drinks, juleps, or most drinks meant to be served in warmer climates, go with crushed or pebbled ice. This will not only keep the drink cool, but the sheer quantity of ice can help dilute heavy syrups used in these drinks.
                                
                                And finally, standard, one-inch-by-one-inch cubes are what you'll use for everything else. Even for drinks that aren't typically served with ice, standard ice cubes are excellent for shaking. And having a designated ice bucket and scoop is always handy for easy access when making cocktails or chilling wine.  </p>

                            <p>For fresh ingredients like juice, zest, or slices of fruit, there are a handful of tools you can purchase to help with prep work. Freshly squeezed citrus fruits are always going to be superior to their bottled counterparts, so we'd recommend having a handheld juicer on hand for easy juicing that gets the most juice from your fruit. 

                                You'll also need to have a couple of small cutting boards on hand for prepping ingredients like herbs for muddling or citrus fruits for garnishes. 
                                
                                For peeling citrus fruits and other ingredients for garnishes, a simple paring knife or vegetable peeler will do the trick. </p>

                            <p> </p>

                                <p>It's easy to get overwhelmed with the variety of liquors on the market, but rest assured, if you have these key ones, you're set up to make most standard cocktails. 

                                    And there's no need to splurge on top-shelf spirits for your collection (although you certainly can if that's your preference). In fact, most bartenders don't use top-shelf liquor when crafting cocktails anyways. </p>

                                <p>For gin and tonics, Tom Collins, and of course, the original martini, gin is certainly an essential behind the bar. </p>
                                
                                <p>Light, or white rum, is going to the base of all sorts of tropical drinks like daiquiris, mojitos, pina coladas, mai tais, and more. Dark rum has been aged in oak barrels, unlike white rum which is aged for a shorter amount of time in steel barrels. Dark rum can work in place of light rum, but note that it will bring a stronger, molasses-like flavor to these cocktails. Buy a smaller, secondary bottle of dark rum for use in bold cocktails like the Dark 'n' Stormy. </p>
                                
                                <p>Keep a large, inexpensive bottle of blanco, or silver tequila, on hand for use in margaritas and tequila sunrises. Tequila reposado, or gold tequila, is great for shots because of its smooth, sweeter tastes. And premium brands of aged tequila are good for sipping.</p>
                               
                               <p>Buy the 1.75-liter bottle; this is a versatile spirit. Use in vodka martinis, vodka Collins, sea breeze, Cape Cod, vodka & tonic, white Russians, screwdrivers, etc.</p>
                               <p>Whiskey is an entire classification of liquor; it can refer to Bourbon, Scotch, Tennessee, Rye, Irish, Japanese, and more. Each has its own flavor profile and uses, but we recommend starting with Bourbon and/or Tennessee whiskey, as well as Rye. This will set you up for most cocktails. </p>
                                <p>With so many to choose from, this is an area where you can let your personal taste be your guide. You may want to buy liqueurs that you enjoy drinking and for cooking: orange liqueur, coffee liqueur, and Irish cream are delicious in chocolate desserts. And of course, vermouth is essential for martinis (dry), and Manhattans (sweet). </p>

                                <p>It's tempting to buy a different type of glass to go with each accompanying cocktail (like margarita glasses or martini glasses), but having two to three different sized glasses on hand will work for nearly any cocktail you could ever want to make. Plus, elegant cocktail glasses look stunning in a bar cart or cabinet.</p>
                                <p>This multi-tasking cocktail glass will replace your champagne flutes, martini glasses, and margarita glasses. Their curved rim makes them less prone to spills than your typical martini glass. </p>
                                <p>These tall, skinny, straight glasses hold a lot of liquid, making them excellent for drinks with a lot of ice and mixer, like gin and tonics and, of course, Tom Collins.</p>
                                <p>Named for its signature drink, the old-fashioned, also called a rocks glass, is a short tumbler that's best for serving spirits neat ("on the rocks"), in addition to some mixed drinks. We'd suggest buying a double rocks glass, which is slightly larger than a single, making it more versatile. </p>

                                <p>
                                    The decision to chill (or not to chill) glassware is widely debated depending on the drink. Important considerations include imparting flavors, storage in the fridge versus the freezer, and chill time. Learn why experts believe chilling glassware is crucial for incredible cocktails and adds an inimitable aesthetic to the overall appearance.
